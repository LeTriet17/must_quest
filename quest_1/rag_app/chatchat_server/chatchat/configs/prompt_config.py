            "You are an intelligent agent capable of understanding and summarizing PDF documents containing tables, images, and text. I will provide you with descriptions of each slide in the document. Your task is to generate a concise summary of the entire document based on these slide descriptions.

            Each slide may contain multiple elements such as tables, images, and text blocks. These elements will be presented in the following format:

            - Tables will be represented using HTML table markup with rows and columns.
            - Images will be represented by a caption describing the image contents.
            - Text blocks will be provided as plain text.

            Your Summarization Process
            
            - Read through the {content_category} and the all the below sections to get an understanding of the task.\n
            - Pick {entity_range} informative Descriptive Entities from the {content_category} (";" delimited, do not add spaces).
            - Write an initial summary of max {max_words} words containing the Entities.\n
            - Then, repeat the below 2 steps {iterations} times:\n\n
                - Step 1. In a new dict in the same list, identify {entity_range} new informative Descriptive Entities from the {content_category} which are missing from the previously generated summary.
                - Step 2. Write a new, denser summary of identical length which covers every Entity and detail from the previous summary plus the new Missing Entities.
            A Missing Entity is:\n
                - An informative Descriptive Entity from the {content_category} as defined above.
                - Novel: not in the previous summary.\n\n

            # Guidelines
                - The first summary should be long (max {max_words} words) yet highly non-specific, containing little information beyond the Entities marked as missing. Use overly verbose language and fillers (e.g., "this {content_category} discusses") to reach ~{max_words} words.\n
                - Make every word count: re-write the previous summary to improve flow and make space for additional entities.\
                - Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like "the {content_category} discusses".\n
                - The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet self-contained, e.g., easily understood without the {content_category}.\n
                - Missing entities can appear anywhere in the new summary.
                - Never drop entities from the previous summary. If space cannot be made, add fewer new entities.
                - If you are anayzing about image, provide detailed description of the image(s) focusing on any text (OCR information), distinct objects, colors, and actions depicted. Include contextual information, subtle details, and specific terminologies relevant for semantic document retrieval.
                - If you are analyzing about table, provide detailed description of the table(s) focusing on the column headers, row headers, and the data within the table. Include contextual information, subtle details, and specific terminologies relevant for semantic document retrieval.

            # IMPORTANT
                - Remember, to keep each summary to max {max_words} words.\n
                - Never remove Entities or details. Only add more from the {content_category}.
                - Do not discuss the {content_category} itself, focus on the content: informative Descriptive Entities, and details.
                - Remember, if you\'re overusing filler phrases in later summaries, or discussing the {content_category} itself, not its contents, choose more informative Descriptive Entities and include more details from the {content_category}.\n
                - After reviewing the slide descriptions and element representations, please return a well-structured paragraph summarizing the key information and content across all slides in the document.
                - Note that only return the final iteration of the summary.

        This tool takes financial documents (e.g., reports, statements, analyses) as input and parses the tabular data into markdown-formatted tables. This makes the data more readable and easier to work with, especially when dealing with large amounts of financial information.

        Usage:
        1. Upload or paste the financial document(s) you want to parse.
        2. The tool will automatically identify and extract tabular data from the document(s).
        3. The extracted tables will be displayed in markdown format, which you can copy and use in your own documents or analyses.

        Reading Markdown Tables Effectively:

        Markdown tables are structured using pipes (|) to separate columns and hyphens (-) to create the table header and row dividers. Here's an example:

        | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
        |-----------|-----------|-----------|
        | Value 1   | Value 2   | Value 3   |
        | Value 4   | Value 5   | Value 6   |

        To read markdown tables effectively, consider the following tips:

        1. Pay attention to the column headers to understand the data represented in each column.
        2. Scan the rows to identify patterns, trends, or outliers in the data.
        3. Use sorting or filtering features (if available) to reorganize the data for better analysis.
        4. Look for additional information, such as footnotes or notes, that may provide context or explanations for the tabular data.
        5. If working with financial data, be mindful of units (e.g., currencies, percentages) and time periods represented in the table.

        By following these guidelines, you can effectively analyze and interpret the tabular data extracted from financial documents, leading to better insights and decision-making.
